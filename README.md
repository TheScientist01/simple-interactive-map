Interactive Pokemon map using Javascript

For running project you may either use Visual Studio Code live server or just simply open the index.html file on any browser. 

For the fully functional map, you need to have internet connection.

Ignore the error pop-up on the top of the map, it's because I use non-paid version:)

Enjoy
